# iplinkgui
Samy Abdellatif

GTK3 GUI app built on top of the ip command line tool for managing the network interfaces in python. My goal is to keep it as simple as possible, this app will only show the physical interfaces and allow the simple operations of switching interfaces on/off and connecting using DHCP or configuring non-permenant static ip with netmask and route.
